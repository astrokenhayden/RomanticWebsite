### Romantic Website

This website was designed with my partner in mind. I tend to love giving love notes. I made it to learn more about bootstrap and how to style and customize things. I also wanted to play around with nodejs and express. 

As I said this website is a love letter to my partner. In the original design I had plenty of custom letters. In the future I want to play around with vue a little more and make it so the dice changes based on which "roll" the user got. 

Thank you for viewing!
